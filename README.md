Bamazon is a CLI node.js app that takes in user-defined inputs via inquirer npm and updates a database using mysql npm.

Bamazon was created as a mock-retail store that takes in user commands & inputs, returns information and/or database tables in the terminal console, and creates, reads, and updates table rows in a database.
